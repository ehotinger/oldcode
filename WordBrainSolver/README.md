# Word Brain Solver

This program helps in solving puzzles for the game "Word Brain" on iOS. It determines from a pre-selected dictionary which words are possible based on the board's pre-defined letters and positioning.

It is required that the user insert the board's state after each iteration (it may take a few tries to get the correct pattern). This is because so many words are possible and there are many possible "correct" options, but only one set is truly "correct" as defined by the app and we don't know it until we enter it!
