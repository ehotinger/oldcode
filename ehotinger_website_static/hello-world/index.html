                        <p>On November 11th, I began working on the second rendition of my website (this one).  I'm hoping to have it somewhat functional within a day or two so that I can upkeep content, but we'll see how things go.  This also depends entirely on how busy I'll be at work in the days to come.</p>

                        <p>My first personal website which now dates nearly a year ago stood solely as a portfolio to outside employers while I was in college looking for a job post-grad.  It used AJAX from Prototype.js with a simple MySQL database to provide CRUD operations for a simple CMS.  It wasn't until after the project that I realized the problems with GoogleBot and caching as well as the unnecessarily complex architecture for such a simple project.  You can check out the original source <a href="https://github.com/ehotinger/ehotinger_website_PHP" title="First Personal Website on Github">here.</a></p>

                        <p>Since I finally got around to uploading some of my old code on <a title="Go to my Github!" href="https://github.com/ehotinger">Github</a> and I promise to upkeep that in the future, I don't think there's much need to have the previous architecture of my website.  Plus, it could use a facelift!</p>

                        <p>This website is intentionally pure and simple - it is a flat model which serves as a beacon of entertainment to some and an archive to my personal endeavors.  If at any time you find a problem with the website (Thanks for checking it out already!!) please feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:ehotinger@gmail.com?subject=Bug">e-mail</a> and describe how to replicate the issue.  Or - if you have some kick-ass content that you think should be here, feel free to send that over too!</p>

                        <p>As a final note, I'm occasionally posting on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1959230/eric-hotinger" title="Go to StackOverflow">StackOverflow</a> about random topics which interest me and hopefully helping other people solve their development problems.  The code for this website will also be posted on Github, so if you're curious about anything, feel free to take a glimpse.</p>
